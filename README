Copy the file to “username/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules”

This language module also works with BBEdit (as of version 8.5).
However, to use the module, you must create the directory

~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules

since it is not created by default after installation. Then simply copy
the Opa.plist file into that directory.
